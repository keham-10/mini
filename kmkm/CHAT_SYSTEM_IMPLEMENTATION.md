## üöÄ How It Works

### Workflow Process

1. **Question Submission (Client)**
   - Client fills questionnaire as before
   - Questions submitted for lead review

2. **Review Process (Lead)**
   - Lead reviews question in updated interface
   - Three options available:
     - **APPROVED**: Freezes question immediately, shows tick mark
     - **NEEDS REVISION**: Creates chat, sends initial message requesting evidence
     - **REJECTED**: Creates chat, allows client to re-select from all 5 options

3. **Chat Communication**
   - Automatic chat creation for "Needs Revision" and "Rejected" statuses
   - Real-time messaging between lead and client
   - File upload support for evidence attachments
   - Lead can approve question directly from chat interface

4. **Question Resolution**
   - **Approved**: Question frozen with green tick mark, chat becomes inactive
   - **Needs Revision ‚Üí Approved**: After evidence provided, lead approves via chat
   - **Rejected ‚Üí Re-submission**: Client re-selects answer, new review cycle begins

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

# 🛡️ SecureSphere - Security Assessment Platform

A comprehensive, professional-grade security assessment platform with client-specific lead assignments, mathematical scoring algorithms, and enterprise-level security features.

## 🌟 Key Features

### ✅ Fully Implemented & Working
- **🔐 Role-Based Access Control**: Superuser, Lead, Client roles with strict permissions
- **🎯 Client-Specific Lead Assignment**: Leads can only access assigned client data
- **🧮 Mathematical Scoring**: Proper dimension averaging and overall maturity calculation
- **🔒 Enterprise Security**: Rate limiting, CSRF protection, secure file uploads
- **📊 Professional UI**: Modern, responsive interface with dashboard analytics
- **💬 Secure Communication**: Lead-client conversation system with evidence uploads
- **🏢 Organization Management**: Default ACCORIAN organization as requested

### 🎯 User Workflow
1. **Admin** creates clients via invitation system
2. **Admin** creates leads and assigns them to specific clients (dropdown selection)
3. **Clients** complete security questionnaires for their products
4. **Assigned leads** review responses and communicate with their client only
5. **Mathematical scoring** provides accurate maturity levels and insights

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Startup Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd xxx
./start_securesphere.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
cd xxx
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
python3 init_database.py --reset
python3 app.py
```

### 🌐 Access the Application
- **URL**: http://localhost:5001
- **Admin Login**: `admin` / `AdminPass123`
- **Organization**: `ACCORIAN`

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ All Security Requirements Met
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 login attempts/minute, 5 registration attempts/minute
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected with tokens
- **File Upload Security**: Size limits, type validation, secure naming
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict client data isolation for leads
- **Secure Credentials**: Environment variable configuration
- **Password Security**: Hashing, complexity requirements, first-login changes

### 🛡️ Data Isolation
- **Leads**: Can ONLY see assigned client data
- **Clients**: Can ONLY see own data
- **Admin**: Can see ALL data (as requested)

## 🧮 Mathematical Scoring

### Implemented Formulas
```
Average Dimension Score = Sum of scores / Number of questions
Overall Maturity Score = Sum of dimension averages / Number of dimensions
```

### Maturity Levels
- **Level 5 - Optimized** (90%+)
- **Level 4 - Managed** (75-89%)
- **Level 3 - Defined** (60-74%)
- **Level 2 - Developing** (40-59%)
- **Level 1 - Initial** (<40%)
